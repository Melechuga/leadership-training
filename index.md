### About Lean Data Practices

Staying lean and being smart about how you collect data can build trust with your members, and ultimately help grow the movement. Lean Data Practices (“LDP”) are techniques for managing data. You don’t need an engineering degree or a dedicated budget to apply LDP. All you need is a commitment from your organization to consider data decisions thoughtfully. The pay-off? LDP helps you build trust with members and reduces operational risk.

### Who is this for?
If you (or your organization) are collecting data from advocates so that you can keep in touch with them, this is for you! If you want to make sure you're getting the data you need while protecting the privacy and security of your members, LDP can help you protect your organization from potential external influences.
