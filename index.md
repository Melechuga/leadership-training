### Why Lean Data Practices?

Lean Data Practices (“LDP”) are a technique to manage data.  You don’t need an engineering degree or a dedicated budget to apply LDP.  All you need is a commitment from your organization to think through data decisions thoughtfully.  The pay-off? LDP helps you build trust with members and reduces operational risk.  

**Increased Trust**
Members are much less likely to take actions or use services of organizations they don’t trust. Once trust is lost, it is hard -- and sometimes impossible -- to regain.

**Reduced Risk**
Every additional byte you store increases your operating costs and the costs to deal with a data or security breach (like legal fees, fines, credit monitoring services, etc.).

### Who is this for?
If you (or your organization) are collecting data from advocates so that you can keep in touch with them, this is for you! If you want to make sure you're getting the data you need while protecting the privacy and security of your members, LDP can help you protect your organization from potential external influences.
